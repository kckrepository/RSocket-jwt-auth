# RSocket-jwt-auth-using-asymmetric-key
here, I try to implement security RSocket application using jwt asymmetric private and public key. In this implementation, client needs to send token, to get response from RSocket server. To complete this. I use NimbusReactiveJwtDecoder for PublicKey builder and also customize ReactiveJwtAuthenticationConverterAdapter to verify user request with database data.
